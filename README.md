# Udaan-1.0
Udaan 1.0 is a flight reservation system whose front-end is made with VB 6.0 and back-end using MS-Access. The software has broadly two sections â€“ one for administrator and the other for users. The software asks for username and password at the beginning and allows access to these portals only if the data entered by the user matches with the records stored in database .The Administrator can add/delete users and modify flight details. The users can book tickets, search for flights and cancel ticket. A database contains details about the flight schedules, fare, passenger reservations and list of users. The software also includes options to create report on flight details and user records. 
The motivation behind this software is to ensure :  
1)Faster  System  
2) Accurate handling of data (Several error checking conditions have been put in place)  
3) Reliable for users  
4) Informative  
5) Reservations and cancellations from anywhere to any place  
6) Secure (A certain level of abstraction between the users and the administrator portal to prevent wrong alteration/misuse of data)

1.	Single login page for both users and Administrator  
2.	 Users can search for information about the flight by means of flight number and also by providing source and destination

A PNR number will also be mentioned in the ticket that acts as unique identification of the ticket. User can also get information about the documents required at the time of boarding.
